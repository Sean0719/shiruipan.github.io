      <description>This project aims to design an artificially intelligent system for a Chinese company, Broadlink, to predict user behaviors of using air-conditioners. Key tasks include:
 Opening Setting Prediction: when a user turn on the air-conditioner, what are his/her expected temperature, wind direction, and wind speed? Setting Adjustment Prediction: when will the user change the setting of air-conditioner after it is turned on? Device Closure Prediction: when will a user turn off the air-conditioner?</description>
