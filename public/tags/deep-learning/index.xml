      <description>Information network mining often requires examination of linkage relationships between nodes for analysis. Recently, network representation has emerged to represent each node in a vector format, embedding network structure, so off-the-shelf machine learning methods can be directly applied for analysis. We have proposed a number of algorithms to address this problem, including:
Continuous Network Embedding Continuous network embedding has been a hot topic since 2014, which aims to embed each node into a compact and  continuous  vector space.</description>

      <title>Deep Structure Learning for Cyberbullying Detection on Social Networks</title>

      <description>This project aims to build a deep structure learning system to detect cyberbullying on social networks to improve the e-safety for children and young people. Detailed research topics include a deep node representation model, a deep-signed link prediction approach, and a multi-task cyberbullying detection algorithm. The outcomes will not only lay the theoretical foundations for building intelligent systems on social networks by integrating multiple view information such as user profiles, network structures, and text messages, but could be also used by public sectors to detect cyberbullying, thus improving e-safety for children.</description>
